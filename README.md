# Air_Canvas_using_CV
The program first detects the object to be used as the writing object (chalk/Marker). 

Then, it traces its motion using the webcam. 

The detected path of the object is traced on the screen and thereby writing on the screen (Blackboards/Whiteboards).

When the object is moved in a way to write a word in the air, the word would be traced to the screen. 

This way, it allows the user to scribble anything in the air and that is traced on the screen.
